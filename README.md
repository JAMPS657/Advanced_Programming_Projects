# Andrew J. Otis: Advanced Programming Projects

## Index
This repository holds projects that I'm particularly proud of during my time at the University of Denver. Some projects demonstrate the application of a new skill and others demonstrate the application of the full Data Science workflow.

## About Me

I'm seeking a professional environment where a well-thought strategy sets the foundation for a well-done job. A place where mutual respect, comradery, effective communication, and hard work are venues for expression. 

My journey in the sciences began majoring in various branches of Chemistry and Biology as an undergraduate at the University of Colorado at Boulder. In my coursework, I had the opportunity to utilize programming languages for various experiments.  The experience fostered an interest in programming in general and it's various applications to data analytics.

I value and appreciate the ability to convey a story through expression, coming in many forms. Whether it's a videogame being an expression of imagination or simply sharing an experience as an expression of community.

Given my recent graduation, I'm seeking a company with the data infrastructure to capitalize on my skillset as a Data Scientist. 

Some personal interests of mine
- An on-and-off relationship with guitar and singing
- Painting, an interest stemming from many years of watching Bob Ross
- Golf, Baseball, Rollerblading. and other outdoor recreational activities
